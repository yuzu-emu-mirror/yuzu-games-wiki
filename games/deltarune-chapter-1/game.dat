description = "Deltarune is a role-playing video game created by American indie developer Toby Fox. The player controls a human, Kris, in a world where monsters live on the surface of the Earth. Kris and a classmate named Susie fall from Earth into a place called the 'Dark World' where they meet Ralsei, who informs them that they are heroes destined to restore balance to the world. The players meet various beings who call themselves 'Darkners' during a prophesied quest to seal the dark fountain. Mainly through the combat system, the player navigates through different kinds of bullet hell attacks by enemies, which can be resolved peacefully or through violence."

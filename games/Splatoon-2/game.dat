So expect a fresh wave of fashion, not to mention new weapons and gear. Dual wield the new Splat Dualies or stick to mainstays like chargers and rollers, which have been remixed with new strategic possibilities. As always, Turf War is the favored sport among Inklings, but they also dig ranked battles, taking down Octarians in a robust single-player campaign, and battling enemy Salmonids in one dangerous part-time job! No matter which way you play, splat at home or on-the-go with Nintendo Switch. Staying fresh never felt so good. Turf War - Team up in fierce 4-on-4 multiplayer battles* to see which team can cover the most turf with ink Salmon Run – 2-4 players* can team up for co-op fun and defeat waves of enemy Salmonids.

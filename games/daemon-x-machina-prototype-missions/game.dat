description = "Defend Earth across four fast-paced demo missions and defeat corrupted A.I. controlled robots using your Arsenal, a fully customizable mechanized battle suit. Choose and equip your Arsenal with a multitude of weapons, obtain more from downed enemy Arsenals, and swap them on the fly to suit your strategy in the face of ever-changing threats that may bring the end of the world.
They say it was the greatest disaster in recorded history... The moon tore apart, turning the sky into a kaleidoscope of red light that illuminated all who watched from below. Survive this apocalyptic new age when the self-evolving weapons called "Immortals" have turned on their creators and waged war on humanity."

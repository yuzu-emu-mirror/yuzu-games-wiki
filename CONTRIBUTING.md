## Info About This Wiki

### Angle Brackets
Throughout this guide, code blocks like `<Value>` are used. This means that "Value" should be replaced by something, and the "<>" should be deleted.

### yuzu Version
All data must be collected from the latest official yuzu Canary, downloaded from [here](https://yuzu-emu.org/downloads/).

### Dates
All dates follow the format `<4-Digit Year>-<2-Digit Month>-<2-Digit Day>`. For example, June 3rd 2017 would be "2017-06-03".

### GitHub Issues
Game issues can be found [here](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/issues). The ID of the issue can be found at the end of the URL. For example, [Intermittent Eternal Freezes (softlocks) - Pokemon Let's Go](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/issues/1935)'s ID is 1935.

### Screenshots
The recommended application for capturing the icon and boxart is [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX) while we recommend using the `Capture Screenshot` feature within yuzu itself for game screenshots. Screenshots can not be compressed, and must be in the PNG format.

### Title IDs
Title IDs can be found by right clicking the game in the game list and selecting `Copy Title ID to Clipboard`. For example, Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove's Title ID is 010057D0021E8000.

### TOML
In this repo, DAT files follow the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) syntax, where each line consists of the creation of a piece of data. The simplest form of this is assigning a value to a key (`<Key> = <Value>`). The data types used for these `Value`s in this wiki are:
 - Booleans, true or false (Example: `true`.)
 - Integers, numbers (Example: `5`.)
 - Strings, characters with surrounding quotes (Example: `"Hi!"`.)
 - Arrays, collection of booleans, integers, or strings (Example for an array of integers: `[33, 2398, 234]`.)

These key/value pairs can be grouped together using an array of tables (Example: `[[ Stuff ]]`, with the pairs on the next lines.). These can be used more than once in a TOML file.

## Code
The code consists of the actual files in the Github repisitory. To modify them, you have to fork this repo, make your changes, and send a pull request.

At the root, there's a folder for each game. The names of these folders should follow these specifications:
- Only use letters, numbers, and hyphens (No spaces!), because they will be linked to on the site.
- Names should be lowercase to ensure consistency.
- Have a wiki page with the same name.

### Metadata
The metadata for the game is located at `/<Game Name>/game.dat`. This is required info about the game, all feilds are mandatory unless noted otherwise. The DAT values (See: [TOML](#toml)) are:
- `title` (String): English title of the game. This doesn't have to match the wiki or folder name, so there can be spaces.
- `description` (String): Get these from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_Switch_games). Short, 2-3 line description of the game.
- `github_issues` (Array of integers): The GitHub issue IDs for the game. See: [GitHub Issues](#github-issues).
- `needs_system_files` (Boolean): Whether the game requests the system files or not, regardless of whether it could be played without them (See: [yuzu Version](#yuzu-version)).
- `needs_shared_font` (Boolean): Whether the game requests the shared font or not, regardless of whether it could be played without them (See: [yuzu Version](#yuzu-version)).
- `game_type` (String): Whether the game has a retail release, `"switch"` or if it's an E-Shop **exclusive**, `"eshop"`. This line is optional for retail releases.
- `releases` (Array of tables): Info about each release of the game. **The USA release should come first.**
  - `title` (String): Title ID of this release of the game. See: [Title IDs](#title-ids).
  - `region` (String): Region of the game. Possible values are:
    - `aus`
    - `chn`
    - `eur`
    - `jpn`
    - `kor`
    - `twn`
    - `usa`
    - `all` (Don't tag a game released in multiple regions as `all`. This is reserved for specific games released as such.)
  - `release_date` (String): When the game was released in this region. See: [Dates](#dates).
  - `title` (String): Title ID of this release of the game which was used during testing. See: [Title IDs](#title-ids).

An example of a game metadata file is the one for [Pokemon: Let's Go, Eevee!](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu-games-wiki/blob/master/games/pokemon-lets-go-eevee/game.dat):
```toml
title = "Pokemon: Let's Go, Eevee!"
description = "Pokemon: Let's Go, Eevee! is a role-playing video game that was developed by Game Freak and published by The Pokemon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The game is the first installment of the main Pokemon RPG series for the Nintendo Switch. It is a enhanced remake of the 1998 video game Pokemon Yellow."
wiki_override = "pokemon-lets-go"
github_issues = [1935]
needs_system_files = false
needs_shared_font = false
game_type = "switch"

[[ releases ]]
title = "0100187003A36000"
region = "all"
release_date = "2018-11-16"
```

### Icon
The icon for a game is located at `/<Game Name>/icon.png` (See: [Screenshots](#screenshots). The suggested process for getting one is:
- Make sure the game is in your yuzu game directory.
- Set the icon size to `Full Size (256x256)` in the yuzu Configuration.
- Take a screenshot of yuzu's library listing (See: [yuzu Version](#yuzu-version)).
- Crop out the game icon.
- The icon should be `256x256`.

### Boxart
The boxart for the game is located at `/<Game Name>/boxart.png`. The suggested process for getting retail boxart is:
- Download a scan from [GameTDB](http://www.gametdb.com/), preferably with the `Nintendo Switch` logo on the right.
- The boxart should be from the USA.
- Downsize it to `328x300` using [PicResize](http://www.picresize.com/).
- Compress it using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

The required process for getting eShop only boxart is:
- Run the game in yuzu (See: [yuzu Version](#yuzu-version)).
- Use 1x internal resolution.
- Increase the window size of yuzu to fill most of your monitor.
- Screenshot the title screen, which should only be the top screen.
- Downsize it to `500x300` using [PicResize](http://www.picresize.com/).
- Compress it using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).
- Examples are [Fairune](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-games-wiki/blob/master/games/fairune/boxart.png) and [Pok√©mon Picross](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-games-wiki/blob/master/games/pokemon-picross/boxart.png)

### Game Screenshots
The screenshots for the game are located in `/<Game Name>/screenshots/` (See: [Screenshots](#screenshots)). Screenshots **must** have a resolution of `1280x720`.

Additionally, if a game has a rating of 3 or higher, **you must include at least 3 screenshots**, otherwise 1 screenshot is acceptable. The names of the screenshots don't matter.

### Savefiles
#### Save Metadata
The metadata for a save is located at `/<Game Name>/savefiles/<Save Name>.dat`. This is info about the save. The DAT values (See: [TOML](#toml)) are:
- `title` (String): The location of the save ingame.
- `description` (String): A brief explanation about the save.
- `author` (String): Your forum account name, if you have one. If you don't, don't include this line.
- `title_id` (String): Title ID of the game.

#### Save Data
The save data is located at `/<Game Name>/savefiles/<Save Name>.zip` (See: [yuzu Version](#yuzu-version)). To make a ZIP file, the process is:
- Make sure the game is in your yuzu game directory.
- Right click on the game and click `Open Save Data Location`. This should open a window prompting you to select the user.
- After selecting the user, you will be taken to the folder in which the save data is stored.
- Compress the files within the folder into a ZIP.

## Wiki
The wiki contains info about specific game problems, and can be modified by anyone. They use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) formatting.

Each page's title should match the game's respective folder in the code section, except with hyphens in the code changed to spaces on the wiki. **Don't use the following characters in your wiki page's titles: \ / : * ? " < > |.**

The format of each page is as follows:
- H2 header with text saying `Summary`.
- Brief summary of how the game performs: graphically, auditorily, and frame rate (with general hardware comparison - see MK7 example). See: [yuzu Version](#yuzu-version).

An example of a game wiki page is the one for [Pokemon: Let's Go](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu-games-wiki/wiki/pokemon-lets-go):
```markdown
Pokemon: Let's Go series currently experiences freezes called softlocks in yuzu.
This currently makes the game unplayable, but does not have major issues aside from the softlocks.

Pokemon: Let's Go goes ingame if you follow the instructions below:

* Dump a save. You can also use ones from the `Savefiles` section.
* Dump and use your NAND and keys from your console following our [quickstart guide](https://yuzu-emu.org/help/quickstart/).
* Choose the "Single Player - Handheld - Undocked" in `Emulation > Configure... > Input`

#### How to get past the controller selection screen
* In the Input Configuration tab, and choose the "Single Player - Handheld - Undocked" profile.
